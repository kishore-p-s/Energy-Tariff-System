<h3>ENEGRGY TARRIF SYSTEM</h3>
Our project aims to revolutionize energy management in households by implementing an innovative energy tariff system. By utilizing ESP32 microcontrollers, Firebase database, and electricity and voltage sensors, we accurately monitor energy consumption by individual components within a house. The system employs a predefined model to calculate monthly electricity costs, offering users detailed insights into their energy usage patterns and facilitating informed decisions for energy conservation and cost optimization.

## Problem statement 
consumption of energy in the world increases day by day and we need to find the best way to reduce the consumption.
## About the project
Our project implements an energy tariff system using ESP32, Firebase, and electricity and voltage sensors to measure energy consumption by each component in a house. It utilizes a predefined model to calculate monthly electricity costs, providing users with insights into their energy usage and bills.


## Technical implemntaion 
1. ESP32: Acts as the central microcontroller for data collection and transmission.
2. Firebase: Serves as the database to store energy consumption data and user information securely.
3. Electricity and Voltage Sensors: Measure the energy consumed by each component in the house.
4. Predefined Model: Utilized for calculating monthly electricity costs based on energy consumption data.

## Techstacks used 
ESP32 , Reactjs , Julia ML , Firebase , voltage and current sensor
Role in the Project:
- ESP32: Facilitates data collection from sensors and communicates with Firebase for data storage and retrieval.
- Firebase: Stores energy consumption data and user information securely, enabling real-time access and analysis.
- Electricity and Voltage Sensors: Measure energy consumption accurately, providing essential input for cost calculation.
- Predefined Model: Calculates monthly electricity costs based on energy consumption data, providing users with insights into their electricity bills.

## How to run locally 
1. *Setup ESP32 Development Environment:*
   - Install Arduino IDE and necessary ESP32 board drivers.
   - Verify that you can successfully upload sketches to your ESP32 board.

2. *Connect LEDs to ESP32:*
   - Connect each LED to a separate GPIO pin on the ESP32, ensuring proper polarity and using current-limiting resistors.

3. *Write Arduino Sketch:*
   - Write an Arduino sketch to control the LEDs, defining GPIO pins and implementing functions to turn LEDs on and off.

4. *Set Up Firebase:*
   - Create a Firebase project and set up a Realtime Database.
   - Obtain Firebase credentials (database URL, authentication key) for ESP32 communication.

5. *Connect ESP32 to Firebase:*
   - Use the Firebase ESP32 library to establish a connection between ESP32 and Firebase.
   - Authenticate ESP32 with Firebase using obtained credentials.

6. *Read and Write Data to Firebase:*
   - Implement functions in the Arduino sketch to read and write data to Firebase, enabling remote control of LEDs.

7. *Update LED States:*
   - Modify the Arduino sketch to update LED states based on data received from Firebase.
   - Ensure LEDs reflect the desired state indicated in the Firebase database.

8. *Test and Debug:*
   - Upload the Arduino sketch to ESP32 and test remote control of LEDs through Firebase.
   - Debug any connectivity or LED control issues encountered during testing.

9. *Refine and Iterate:*
   - Refine the prototype based on testing feedback.
   - Iterate on the design and functionality to improve reliability and user experience.
